Example URL:

Security Enhancements (Recommended):

Real API Key: Instead of deriving from "banana", generate a long, random API key (e.g. 32 or 64 random hexadecimal characters) and store it directly in the script or in a configuration file.
PHP

// At the beginning of the script:
// $correctApiKey = 'your_random_very_long_and_secure_key_here';

If you want to create an astral user and an astral folder and a www user

1. Create a User in Linux
To create the user that will have specific permissions:
sudo adduser www

- The command will ask you to set a password and other basic information.

- Make sure that the user only has access to the necessary folders and commands.

2. Create a Group and Add the User
Create a group called dockerusers (or whatever name you prefer) and add the user www:
sudo groupadd dockerusers
sudo usermod -aG dockerusers www

- This will add the user to the group and allow them to run Docker-related commands (if configured).

3. Allow Access to Docker
Ensure that the dockerusers group has permission to use Docker without needing sudo:
sudo usermod -aG docker www

After that, reboot to ensure that the permissions are applied:
newgrp docker

4. Configure Folders
Ensure that the folders required for the Docker command are accessible to the www user:
sudo mkdir -p /home/astral/astralcoin /home/astral/astralcoin/solana-data
sudo chown -R www:www /home/astral/astralcoin

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
This sets read/write permissions for the www user.

5. Run the Docker Command
Make sure that Docker is installed. Otherwise, install it with:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io

Then, you can run the command with the www user:
sudo docker run --rm \
-v /home/astral/astralcoin:/solana-token \
-v /home/astral/astralcoin/solana-data:/root/.config/solana \
heysolana solana balance

6. Configure Permissions on the www User
If you need the www user to have access to additional groups, you can edit it directly:
sudo usermod -aG www-data www

The www-data group is commonly used in web configurations, but check if it is necessary before adding it.

7. Document and Simplify
For the tutorial:
- Describe each step in detail.
- Include explanations about security (limiting permissions, preventing unnecessary access, etc.).
- If the script requires additional adjustments, such as environment variables, explain how to set them.

With these steps, you will have a working guide to setting up your Linux environment and running the Docker command in the context of your project. Need help formatting this in plain text or adding more details? üöÄ
